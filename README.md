# Amazon-Alexa-Skill-Intern-Hackathon

MentorConnect is a platform that connects Amazon interns to mentors through the Alexa Skill. We are a team of five SDE interns, four from Stanford and one from Drexel University, and we believe that we could offer help during the pre-onboarding process to future interns by reducing the friction of connecting interns to mentors. The skill works by creating a database of available mentors and immediately connects to an intern who wants to chat by initiating a conference call to both parties’ phone numbers. MentorConnect was created using Node.js and uses Twilio for bridging phone calls and DynamoDB for maintaining user information and availability. We aimed for the design to be as widely available to all interns by making the skill available for use through the Alexa App on any smartphone, and Twilio helps to maintain the inclusiveness of the platform. Moreover, we integrated with DynamoDB for future scalability since Amazon’s intern program is large and ever-growing. This skill was a great learning experience for learning the development of an Alexa Skill from scratch and learning how to work together as a team remotely. We really hope that this platform allows both interns and mentors to learn from and each other and that you decide to mentor in the future with MentorConnect!
